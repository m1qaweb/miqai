# Phase 2 MLOps Loop Integration Test Report

**Date:** 2025-07-01
**Status:** Completed
**Outcome:** Success

## 1. Test Plan Summary

This report documents the end-to-end integration test for the Phase 2 MLOps pipeline.

- **Objective:** Validate the automated workflow for detecting model drift, deploying a shadow model, and facilitating model promotion.
- **Test Workflow:**
  1.  **Drift Injection:** Introduce synthetic drift into the production data stream to simulate a change in data distribution.
  2.  **Alerting:** Verify that the `DriftDetectionService` correctly identifies the concept drift and triggers a system-wide alert.
  3.  **Shadow Deployment:** Confirm that the alert automatically triggers the `ShadowTestingService` to deploy the designated candidate model in shadow mode.
  4.  **Comparison & Promotion:** Ensure the `ComparisonService` correctly evaluates the shadow model's performance against the production model and that the governance dashboard accurately reflects the comparison for a manual promotion decision.
  5.  **Validation:** Confirm that after promotion, the new model version correctly serves all production traffic.

## 2. Initial Test Failure: Security Vulnerability

The initial test execution failed during the shadow deployment step (Workflow Step 3).

- **Root Cause:** A security review prompted by the test failure identified that the `ShadowTestingService` was configured with an insecure default setting. This allowed the service to pull models from the registry without enforcing authentication. This vulnerability could have allowed an unauthorized user to load a malicious or unverified model into a production-adjacent environment.
- **Reference:** This issue is documented as part of the service interaction threat vectors in the [`threat_model.md`](../security/threat_model.md).
- **Impact:** The test was immediately halted, and the vulnerability was escalated to the security and development teams for remediation.

## 3. Implemented Fix

The vulnerability was remediated by enforcing strict authentication and authorization for all internal service-to-service communication with the model registry.

- **Action:** The system configuration was updated to mandate authentication for all model registry interactions.
- **Details:** A new configuration parameter, `MODEL_REGISTRY_SECURE_AUTH`, was added to [`src/video_ai_system/config.py`](../../src/video_ai_system/config.py). This flag is enabled by default in the production environment, ensuring that any service (including the `ShadowTestingService`) must present a valid, scoped token to access model artifacts.

  ```python
  # Example from config.py
  # Enforces auth tokens for all model registry access.
  MODEL_REGISTRY_SECURE_AUTH: bool = os.getenv("MODEL_REGISTRY_SECURE_AUTH", "True").lower() == "true"
  ```

## 4. Successful Test Results & Conclusion

After applying the security fix, the integration test was re-executed from start to finish.

- **Outcome:** The entire MLOps loop completed successfully. Drift was detected, the shadow model was deployed securely using authenticated requests, performance was compared, and the model was successfully promoted via the governance dashboard.
- **Conclusion:** The Phase 2 MLOps loop is now **validated** and considered operational. The automated pipeline for drift detection, shadow testing, and model promotion meets the required security and functionality standards for production deployment.
