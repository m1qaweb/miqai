# The Insight Engine API

Welcome to the API documentation for The Insight Engine. This document provides a comprehensive overview of our API, which is designed to be powerful, flexible, and easy to use.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to obtain an API key from your account page. All API requests must be authenticated with this key, which should be included in the `Authorization` header of your requests.

## API Reference

Our API is organized into the following resources:

-   **[Uploads](uploads.md)**: Endpoints for uploading videos and managing your media library.
-   **[Summarization](summarization.md)**: Endpoints for generating intelligent summaries from your videos.
-   **[Clip Extraction](clips.md)**: Endpoints for extracting clips from your videos based on object detection.

Each of these resources has its own dedicated documentation page, which provides detailed information on the available endpoints, request and response formats, and example usage.
