# System Security

This document provides an overview of the security posture, controls, and procedures for the AI Video Analysis System.

## Guiding Principles

- **Defense in Depth:** Employ multiple layers of security controls to protect system assets.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions for any user, service, or component to perform its function.
- **Secure by Design:** Integrate security considerations into every phase of the system development lifecycle.

## Threat Model

A detailed analysis of potential threats, threat agents, and mitigation strategies is maintained in the system's threat model. This document is regularly reviewed and updated as the system evolves.

For more details, see the [Threat Model](security/threat_model.md).

## CI/CD Security Controls

To mitigate risks early in the development process, we have integrated security checks directly into our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

### Dependency Scanning

**Threat:** Software Supply Chain Attack. Our system, like any modern software, relies on third-party open-source packages. A vulnerability in one of these dependencies could be exploited by an attacker to compromise our system.

**Mitigation:** We use `pip-audit` to automatically scan our Python dependencies against a database of known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) on every commit.

**Developer Workflow:**

- The `pip-audit` scan is a **mandatory** step in the CI pipeline.
- If a dependency with a known vulnerability is detected, the build will **fail**.
- Developers are responsible for addressing the identified vulnerability, which typically involves:
  1. Upgrading the package to a non-vulnerable version.
  2. Finding an alternative package if a patched version is not available.
  3. In rare, well-justified cases, a vulnerability can be temporarily ignored with a documented risk acceptance from the security team.

This proactive control helps ensure that we are not introducing known security holes into our production environment.
