# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Insight Engine project requires comprehensive quality improvements to address critical issues in code quality, architecture, security, testing, and maintainability. The analysis revealed multiple areas where the codebase deviates from production-ready standards and best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Error Handling and Logging Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want consistent error handling and structured logging throughout the application, so that I can effectively debug issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an exception occurs in any service THEN the system SHALL log the error with structured context including request ID, user ID, and relevant metadata
2. WHEN handling exceptions THEN the system SHALL use specific exception types instead of generic Exception catches
3. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL use consistent log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) with appropriate context
4. WHEN an API endpoint encounters an error THEN the system SHALL return standardized error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
5. WHEN background tasks fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2: Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want the application to follow security best practices, so that sensitive data and system access are properly protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL implement proper JWT validation with secure secret management
2. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks
3. WHEN storing secrets THEN the system SHALL use environment variables or secure secret management services
4. WHEN making external API calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper timeout and rate limiting
5. WHEN handling file uploads THEN the system SHALL validate file types, sizes, and scan for malicious content
6. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL disable debug modes and remove development-only configurations

### Requirement 3: Type Safety and Code Quality

**User Story:** As a developer working on the codebase, I want comprehensive type hints and code quality tools, so that I can catch errors early and maintain code consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing Python code THEN all functions and methods SHALL have complete type annotations
2. WHEN defining data models THEN the system SHALL use Pydantic models with proper validation
3. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL pass mypy type checking without errors
4. WHEN committing code THEN the system SHALL pass linting checks with black, isort, and flake8
5. WHEN defining API endpoints THEN the system SHALL have complete OpenAPI documentation with request/response schemas

### Requirement 4: Testing Coverage and Quality

**User Story:** As a development team, I want comprehensive test coverage with quality tests, so that I can confidently deploy changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing new code THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 80% test coverage
2. WHEN testing services THEN the system SHALL include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
3. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL test both success and error scenarios
4. WHEN testing async code THEN the system SHALL properly test asynchronous operations
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use proper mocking for external dependencies
6. WHEN testing database operations THEN the system SHALL use test databases or proper fixtures

### Requirement 5: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want centralized and environment-specific configuration management, so that I can deploy the application across different environments safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific configuration files
2. WHEN accessing configuration THEN the system SHALL validate all required settings at startup
3. WHEN using external services THEN the system SHALL configure timeouts, retries, and circuit breakers
4. WHEN handling secrets THEN the system SHALL never expose sensitive values in logs or error messages
5. WHEN starting the application THEN the system SHALL fail fast if critical configuration is missing

### Requirement 6: Performance and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and performance optimization, so that I can ensure the system runs efficiently and detect issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL implement proper caching strategies for frequently accessed data
2. WHEN making database queries THEN the system SHALL optimize queries and implement connection pooling
3. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL implement proper async/await patterns
4. WHEN running background tasks THEN the system SHALL monitor task queues and processing times
5. WHEN serving the application THEN the system SHALL expose health check endpoints and metrics
6. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL implement streaming and chunked processing

### Requirement 7: Database and Data Management

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want proper database schema management and data validation, so that data integrity is maintained and migrations are handled safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use proper database schemas with constraints and indexes
2. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL implement versioned database migrations
3. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL use Pydantic models with comprehensive validation rules
4. WHEN handling concurrent access THEN the system SHALL implement proper locking and transaction management
5. WHEN backing up data THEN the system SHALL implement automated backup and recovery procedures

### Requirement 8: Frontend Code Quality

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent code quality standards and proper error handling in the React application, so that the user interface is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing TypeScript code THEN the system SHALL have strict type checking enabled
2. WHEN handling API calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and loading states
3. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use consistent state management patterns
4. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL follow consistent design system patterns
5. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL optimize bundle size and implement proper caching

### Requirement 9: Documentation and Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a new developer joining the project, I want comprehensive documentation and development tools, so that I can quickly understand and contribute to the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN the system SHALL provide automated setup scripts
2. WHEN documenting APIs THEN the system SHALL maintain up-to-date OpenAPI specifications
3. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL include inline documentation for complex logic
4. WHEN onboarding developers THEN the system SHALL provide clear README files with setup instructions
5. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide proper development tools and debugging configurations

### Requirement 10: Deployment and Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want reliable deployment processes and infrastructure as code, so that deployments are consistent and environments are reproducible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL use containerized deployments with proper health checks
2. WHEN scaling the application THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling with load balancing
3. WHEN managing infrastructure THEN the system SHALL use infrastructure as code with version control
4. WHEN monitoring deployments THEN the system SHALL implement proper rollback mechanisms
5. WHEN handling secrets in deployment THEN the system SHALL use secure secret management in the deployment pipeline
